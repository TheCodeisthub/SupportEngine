        Hi there, my name is Lenny Johnson and I'm the founder of SupportEngine.
        I started this company early this year after being inspired by Brian
        Norris and all he was doing with WPCurve.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I figured that if Wordpress support could be made more reliable and
        affordable then why not customer support and so the idea for
        SupportEngine was born.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We still have a long way to go before we can be the WPCurve of customer
        support , but in the mean time feel free to reach out to me if you have
        any questions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm on twitter @thelennyJohnson or you can just email me at
        lenny@supportengine.com
